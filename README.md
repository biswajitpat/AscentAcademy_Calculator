This is a responsive scientific calculator made by using html, CSS and Javascript. i have used css grid system to align the keys and javascript eventlisteners to make it functional. I have used the neuromorphism design for this webapp. We can perform all the basic algebraic functions like addition ,multiplication , division and substraction and other than that it can also perform other mathematical operations.            
The eyecatching feature is the toggler mode by which we can switch to dark and light modes.
